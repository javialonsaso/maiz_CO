abstract = {Due to climate changes and increasing food needs, it is important to develop simple models of wide application to determine the irrigation needs. The aim of this study was to calibrate and validate the AquaCrop model in maize crop of the variety ICA V156 in different locations of Colombia, such as Chinchina (Caldas), Palmira (Valle del Cauca) and Cerete (Cordoba), situated at altitudes of 20, 900, and 1,340 m a.s.l., respectively. As part of the model calibration, the biomass, harvest index, and grain yield were recorded. After the calibration, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the respective analysis of variance were calculated for each variable. The biomass, harvest index and grain yield were different in each study site, with the highest grain obtained in Cerete, followed by Chinchina and, finally, Palmira. The modeling in each of the locations showed similarity between the field data and the simulated data in each of the sites. In the calibration, Palmira had the highest grain yield (4.9 t ha-1), followed by Chinchina (4.83 t ha-1) and Cerete (4.15 t ha-1). The validation in each location allowed for the determination of the grain yield, harvest index, biomass and the amount of water needed for crop growth, which averaged 3.45 kg of biomass per m3 of evapotranspired water and was reflected in an average yield of 1.26 kg of grain per m3 of evapotranspired water.},

este art{\'{i}}culo interesa para hablar de la influencia del sistema de riego en el rendimiento de las plantaciones y para justificar posibles resultados en base a esto, al menos como una de las razones. 

adem{\'{a}}s creo que las regiones de colombia de las que habla coinciden (al menos alguna) con las que hemos usado nosotros.},
